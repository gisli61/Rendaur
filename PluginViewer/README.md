#  PluginViewer

Can be run as a normal mac application or from command line using cli/raunder.sh

## Outstanding issues

1. Check for match (manufacturer, type, subtype) with current plugin when loading presets
2. Fix layout issues in window.
3. play/render doesn't work after render has been run once
4. Allow user to specify pad at end of song (to allow for reverb etc)
5. Support true float 32bit
6. Full AppleScript support
7. Combine play/stop button and make machine stop after song ends
8. Enable/Disable buttons appropriately in UI
9. Let functions in CLI report errors and stop processing on errors (if load plugin fails, there is no point to continue)
10. Create a program to extract AU presets out of ALS files
11. Set menus up correctly
12. Allow user to save current AU settings as presets
13. Display parameters (fullparametertree) for audio units.
14. Add Generic view for AU without a custom view.
